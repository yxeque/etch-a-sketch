## Etch-A-Sketch 

I did the UI mostly by myself, but got carriied real hard by ChatGPT at the backend (didn't see enough resources about this project, so YouTube wasn't much help).

NOTE TO SELF: Recreate this project from scratch (without ChatGPT) after we finish the the Foundations Course.

### Features:
- Simulates an etch-a-sketch toy by leaving colors on the grid canvas upon mouse hover
- Adjustable grid size - up to 100 x 100
- Toggleable Randomize button that randomizes each cell color
